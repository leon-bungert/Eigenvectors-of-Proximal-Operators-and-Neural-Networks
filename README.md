# Eigenvectors of Proximal Operators and Neural Networks
This Python and MATLAB code allows to reproduce some of the results of <b>Nonlinear Power Method for Computing Eigenvectors of Proximal Operators and Neural Networks</b> [1].
Feel free to use it and please refer to our paper when doing so.

## Prerequistes
The code for the proximal power method is written in Python and requires the Operator Discretization Library (ODL) https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/index.html.
The code for the power method for the denoising neural network FFDnet [2] is written in MATLAB.
