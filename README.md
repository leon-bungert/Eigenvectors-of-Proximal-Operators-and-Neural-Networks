# Eigenvectors of Proximal Operators and Neural Networks
This Python code allows to reproduce the results of <b>Nonlinear Power Method for Computing Eigenvectors of Proximal Operators and Neural Networks</b> [1].

## Prerequistes
Part of our code requires the Operator Discretization Library (ODL) https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/index.html.
